## Dissertation project - App for learning to pronounce Welsh

### Motivation

Even if one is not interested in fully learning how to speak Welsh, it can still be useful to know how to pronounce common Welsh names and words. In everyday life, one often encounters small pieces of Welsh text or placenames (for instance on signs) of which someone without knowledge of Welsh has very little idea on how to pronounce it. To deal with this, the idea is to develop a smartphone app which (1) can use the phone's camera to determine (OCR) the text on the sign and (2) uses Welsh speech synthesis to show how to pronounce it. The advantage of this is that it would allow one to learn Welsh pronunciation in a natural way, based on what one encounters in everyday life.
